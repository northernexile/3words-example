# About 3 Words Example

This repo consumes a Laravel package I am authoring to make use of the What3Words API (https://what3words.com/pretty.needed.chill) the package repo is here https://github.com/northernexile/3WordsPhp

This is a laravel example project using Laravel Sail, it is being developed in a <b>Laravel Sail</b> docker container.

## Installing
- clone this repository
- run `./vendor/bin/sail up -d`

Normal laravel commands can be executed inside the container with a sail prefix e.g `sail artisan`

Currently only the back end has been worked on.
